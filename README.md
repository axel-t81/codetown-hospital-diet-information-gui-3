# Codetown Hospital Diet Information (GUI)

## Programming Task 3 of UNE's COSC110 Introduction to Programming and the UNIX Environment

### Program Guide

This is a basic GUI using Python's Tkinter. It was the 3rd individual programming task for COSC110 at the University of New England (UNE).

While the exact requirements of the program remain the IP of UNE, the aim of the program is as following:
* See the nutrional information of each of the standardised diets available in the hospital.
* Selecting and viewing this information is done within a resizeable GUI.
* Hospital staff members can run the program and then use the GUI and it's buttons to select the different standardised diets.
* After a diet's button is clicked, the nutrional macros for that diet are diplayed, and the kilojoules (kJs) for that diet are calculated within the program and also diplayed.
* While this 3rd Codetown Hospital program is far simpler than the first two, ideally the GUI would make it more user-friendly for the hospital's staff to use.
